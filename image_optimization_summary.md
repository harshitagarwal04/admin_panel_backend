# Docker Image Optimization Summary

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Multi-stage Build**
- **Builder stage**: Contains gcc, g++, and build tools
- **Final stage**: Only runtime dependencies (curl)
- Build artifacts (gcc, build tools) are not included in final image

### 2. **Wheel Caching**
- Python packages are built as wheels in builder stage
- Only compiled wheels are copied to final stage
- Removes need for build dependencies in final image

### 3. **Minimal Runtime Dependencies**
- Original: gcc + all build dependencies
- Optimized: Only curl for health checks
- Significant reduction in system packages

### 4. **Layer Optimization**
- Combined RUN commands where possible
- Removed package manager cache (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`)
- No intermediate files left in image

## Expected Size Reduction

### Original Image (~225 MB)
- Python 3.11-slim base: ~45 MB
- gcc and build tools: ~60 MB
- Python packages: ~100 MB
- Application code: ~20 MB

### Optimized Image (Estimated ~120-150 MB)
- Python 3.11-slim base: ~45 MB
- curl only: ~5 MB
- Python packages (wheels): ~70 MB
- Application code: ~20 MB

**Expected Reduction: 35-45%**

## Benefits
1. Faster deployment times
2. Lower storage costs
3. Reduced attack surface (fewer packages)
4. Better layer caching
5. Cleaner separation of build and runtime
